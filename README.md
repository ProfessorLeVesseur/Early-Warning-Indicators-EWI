The code offers an example of how you might use apply logistic regression to develop a classifier to make predictions regarding student's probability of dropping out of school. 

**Early Warning Indicators (EWI)**

EWI are data points that district and school staff use to determine which students are at-risk for dropping out. Most of the EWIs are measured at the end of each term (each quarter, semester, or trimester). Students are flagged with an EWI if they meet certain risk thresholds. EWIs fall into one of four categories: attendance, behavior, course performance, and incoming risk: 

*   The attendance EWI cutoff for at-risk is absent from 10 percent of instructional days. 
*   The behavior EWI cutoff for at-risk is suspended or expelled for any length of time. 
*   The course performance EWI cutoff for at-risk is failing at least one core course or a GPA under 2.0. 
*   The incoming risk EWI cutoff for at-risk is students with at least one EWI flagged from the previous term. 

In education, the number of Early Warning Indicators (EWI) that constitute at-risk can vary depending on the school, district, or state. However, typically a student is considered at-risk if they meet or exceed a certain number of EWI thresholds. For example, in some schools or districts, a student may be considered at-risk if they meet two or more EWI thresholds, while in others, the threshold may be three or more. Additionally, some schools or districts may weight different EWI categories differently, such as giving more weight to attendance or behavior than to course performance. Ultimately, the number of EWI that constitute at-risk is determined based on research and best practices in the field, as well as the specific needs and characteristics of the student population. The goal of using EWI to identify at-risk students is to provide early intervention and support to help these students succeed academically and stay on track to graduate.

**Logistic Regression**

Logistic regression is a statistical method used to analyze relationships between a binary outcome variable and one or more predictor variables. The goal of logistic regression is to model the probability of the outcome variable (e.g., "yes" or "no") as a function of the predictor variables. This is done by fitting a logistic function to the data, which maps the predictor variables to a probability of the outcome variable. Logistic regression is a widely used technique in various fields, including medicine, psychology, and social sciences, to model and predict the likelihood of events such as disease onset, credit default, or customer churn, and to identify the most important predictors of those events.

**Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)**

The ROC curve is a graphical representation of the performance of a binary classifier that shows the trade-off between the:
* sensitivity (true positive rate) and the;
* specificity (true negative rate) at various classification thresholds.

The ROC curve is created by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various thresholds. The TPR is the proportion of positive instances that are correctly classified as positive, and the FPR is the proportion of negative instances that are incorrectly classified as positive. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a measure of the performance of the binary classifier, with an AUC of 1.0 indicating perfect classification, while an AUC of 0.5 indicates no better than random guessing. The cutoff point is the threshold that is used to classify instances as positive or negative. For example, in a binary classifier that predicts whether a patient has a disease, the cutoff point could be set at a probability of 0.5, where instances with a predicted probability greater than 0.5 are classified as positive, and those with a predicted probability less than 0.5 are classified as negative. The choice of the cutoff point depends on the trade-off between the sensitivity and specificity that is desired. If a high sensitivity is desired, the cutoff point can be set lower, so that more instances are classified as positive, even at the cost of higher false positives. Conversely, if a high specificity is desired, the cutoff point can be set higher, so that fewer instances are classified as positive, but with a lower false positive rate. The ROC curve can help in selecting an appropriate cutoff point for a given classifier, based on the desired trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.
